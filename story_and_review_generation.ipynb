    "\n",
    "- After using `OpenAI model` for `story generation` which is `highly reliable` model with comparitively high input/output token limit, I **couldn't find any equally reliable model** for consistent and reliable output delivery **for review generation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have gone through most important models available in HuggingFaceHub model repositories and tried my hands over many models using inference API of HuggingFaceHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Got access in a very short span of time in meta waitlist and tried the latest `Llama2-70b` model but it isn't providing API access as of now.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then tried with `google-fang` models in HuggingFaceHub model space. Though they were accessible easily, they didn't provide output for a set no. of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then searched whether there's access for Google's `BARD API` and Google's `PALM` model. But BARD doesn't provide API services as of now and PALM API available only in US and that too with quite a big waitlist to get access... So, left this option as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then randomly I went through an old twitter(now X) DM from a developer where he seem to have asked me to test his new library named `litellm` that he built. But, I haven't noticed it back then and now went through his repo and found that he used `Cohere` somewhere. That's when I tried my hands with the same, got API access and have luckily found it to be `integrated with Langchain` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also **important thing to notice** here is **even with cohere's nightly models, I couldn't get reliable results** for review generation though it was way better than other models that I have tried. Then I have gone through cohere website completely and found a way to build a **custom model with cohere as base model.** Then I `created custom jsonl dataset` with some `40 examples` of how the prompt would be and how the response should be using GPT 3.5 Turbo and used the same to fine-tune the custom model. That's what I have used below as cohere model. You can see that I have given a lengthy string for model parameter - `'a6cbb8d1-1bb6-415c-9543-c0484ee3a5b8-ft'`"

      "\n",
      "One day, while exploring the woods, Lily stumbled upon a wounded baby dragon. The dragon had a twisted wing and was unable to fly. Lily's heart filled with compassion, and she decided to help the dragon. She gently approached the dragon, speaking softly and reassuringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her surprise, the dragon understood her words and responded with a low, rumbling purr. Lily carefully tended to the dragon's wing, placing a splint and bandages to help it heal. Days turned into weeks, and Lily visited the dragon every day, bringing it food and keeping it company.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the dragon's wing began to heal, Lily realized that she needed to find a way to teach the dragon to fly. She consulted the wise old owl who lived in the tallest tree in the forest. The owl shared ancient wisdom and guided Lily on a quest to find a rare, magical feather that could grant the dragon the ability to fly once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, Lily and the dragon embarked on an incredible adventure. They traversed dark caves, crossed treacherous rivers, and climbed towering mountains. Along the way, they encountered talking animals, mischievous fairies, and kind-hearted giants who all joined their quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after many trials and tribulations, Lily found the magical feather hidden atop a majestic waterfall. She carefully plucked the feather and gently placed it on the dragon's back. As soon as the feather touched the dragon's scales, it began to shimmer and glow.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a gleeful roar, the dragon spread its wings and soared into the sky, leaving streaks of sparkling fairy dust in its wake. Lily watched in awe as her beloved dragon friend soared higher and higher, exploring the vast, magical realm they had discovered together.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forward, the dragon and Lily remained inseparable. Together, they embarked on countless adventures, helping others in need and spreading love and kindness throughout the enchanted land.\n",
